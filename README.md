# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [How to Add Multiple Instant App Features to Your App][published url]
## Instructor: [Jessica Thornsby][instructor url]


In this three part series we’ve been exploring Android instant apps, a new feature provides an entirely new way of reaching users who don’t currently have your app installed on their device, by making your app discoverable and accessible from any location that supports URLs, including emails, Google search results, posts on social media platforms, YouTube comments, and forums.

In the first post, we looked at what instant apps are, how they work, and the major benefits they have to offer both Android developers and Android app users. We even got some hands-on experience with instant apps, by using Android Studio’s project creation wizard to quickly and easily generate a project that was pre-configured to support Android instant apps.

In the second post, I used the downloadable MyLocation sample app to demonstrate how you’d update an existing Android project to support the instant apps feature. If you’ve been following along since the beginning, then by this point you’ll have successfully reconfigured the MyLocation project to include a single feature module that can run on any Android Virtual Device (AVD) without you having to install the full MyLocation app. 

However, MyLocation currently only consists of a single base feature module, and when it comes real-life Android projects, you’ll often want to offer multiple features in instant app form. In this final instalment, I’m going to show you how to add multiple feature modules to your Android projects, by walking you through the process of adding a second feature module to MyLocation, and then mapping this module to a different URL.

Finally, to make sure you’re getting the most out of instant apps, we’ll be rounding off this series by taking a look at some instant app best practices.
